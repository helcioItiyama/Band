# DWS Brazil Mobile Test

---

Hello! If you are reading this, it means that you want to join us! This is awesome, and also a great opportunity for you to blow us away with your coding skills.

So here’s the deal:

1. Do as much as you can and don’t rush to finish everything.
2. Give it your best.
3. Tip: take a time to read all the phases below before to start.

If you are ok with that, here’s the test (buckle up!):

#### Create a project to complete the required phases below:

##### Phase 1

- Display a list of bands from a given json file: `bands.json`, which contains a band name and a band id.
- Try to make it look nice and fancy!

##### Phase 2

- Now that you have the list of bands in an app screen, you should be able to click on a band to show its albums.
- There is a static endpoint for the albums: `https://iws-brazil-labs-iws-recruiting-bands-mobile.iwsbrazil.io/api/albums`.
- This API returns all the albums of all the bands. You should filter the albums for a specific band using the band `id`.
- It is up to you of how the UI will looks like for the albums list, ok?!

##### Phase 3

- Now it is time for the album details page!
- For the details, in addition to the album's name, it is important to have the image, released date and the list with the tracks.
- Just like the previous phases, try to make it look great!

##### Phase 4

- Make the data available offline.
- If you ask for an information, your application don't need to ask the same information again to the service.
- The same applies for when you close your application and open again.

##### Phase 5

- Did you finish in time? Awesome! This phase is an oportunity for you to add a functionality that you think the app should have.

##### Finish

- Return your source code in 3 hours after you received these instructions. Not a minute more.

##### Last but not least

- We are looking for responsible people. Please DO NOT share this test or any information about it.

We wish you good luck!

DWS Brazil team.
